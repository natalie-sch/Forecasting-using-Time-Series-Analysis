# Forecasting using Time Series Analysis
### Discussion and application of ARIMA and ETS models on stock prices

This paper analyzes the suitability of time series analysis models to forecast stock prices. For the
analysis, the stock prices of Microsoft are collected from 1987, around the time when the company
became listed on the stock market, to 2021. It is discussed which of the ARIMA and ETS models give
a higher goodness of fit for the underlying stock price series. The most suitable models are chosen and
evaluated regarding their forecasting accuracy. It is concluded that the ARIMA(0,1,1) model with drift
slightly outperforms the ETS(A,A,N) model for the underlying series. Over the last decades, Microsoftâ€™s
stock prices faced severe breaks, making forecasting particularly complex. To better account for such
complexity, further research is suggested in combining time series analysis with Machine Learning and
Deep Learning approaches.
